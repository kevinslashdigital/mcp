- `uv` package manager
- Basic understanding of MCP concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- How to build a complete MCP server from scratch
- How to create an interactive client with natural language interface
- How to integrate tools, resources, and prompts seamlessly
- How to handle real-world MCP communication patterns

## What Makes This Special

This tutorial is **different** from the others because:

âœ… **Complete System** - Both server and client in one tutorial  
âœ… **Interactive Experience** - Chatbot-like natural language interface  
âœ… **Real-world Example** - Task management system you can actually use  
âœ… **Full Integration** - Demonstrates all MCP concepts together  
âœ… **Production Ready** - Includes error handling, persistence, and testing  

## The Task Management Server

Our MCP server provides a complete task management system:

### ðŸ”§ **Tools Available:**
- `create_task` - Create new tasks with priorities and due dates
- `complete_task` - Mark tasks as completed
- `list_tasks` - List tasks with filtering options
- `update_task` - Modify existing tasks
- `delete_task` - Remove tasks
- `add_note` - Add notes to tasks
- `set_reminder` - Set reminders for tasks

### ðŸ“š **Resources Available:**
- `tasks://all` - All tasks in the system
- `tasks://pending` - Only pending tasks
- `tasks://completed` - Only completed tasks
- `tasks://priority/{level}` - Tasks by priority level
- `tasks://project/{name}` - Tasks by project

### ðŸ’¬ **Prompts Available:**
- `task_breakdown` - Break down complex tasks into subtasks
- `project_plan` - Generate project plans from descriptions
- `daily_summary` - Create daily task summaries
- `productivity_tips` - Get productivity suggestions

## The Interactive Client

Our client provides a **chatbot-like experience**:

```
ðŸ¤– Task Manager Assistant
How can I help you manage your tasks today?

> create a task to finish the project report
âœ… Created task: "Finish the project report" (Priority: Medium, Due: Tomorrow)

> show me all my high priority tasks
ðŸ“‹ High Priority Tasks (2):
â€¢ Fix critical bug in authentication system (Due: Today)
â€¢ Complete quarterly review presentation (Due: Friday)

> help me break down the project report task
ðŸ’¡ Task Breakdown Suggestions:
1. Research and gather data sources
2. Create outline and structure
3. Write introduction and executive summary
4. Develop main content sections
5. Review and edit for clarity
6. Format and finalize document
```

## Step 1: Setup

Create a new project:

```bash
uv init complete-server-client
cd complete-server-client
uv add "mcp[cli]"
```

## Step 2: Run the System

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)

Start the server:
```bash
uv run mcp run server.py
```

In another terminal, start the beautiful web interface:
```bash
uv add streamlit
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Option 2: Command Line Interface

Start the server:
```bash
uv run mcp run server.py
```

In another terminal, start the interactive client:
```bash
uv run python client.py
```

## Step 3: Try It Out

The client provides natural language interaction:

- **"Create a task to..."** - Creates new tasks
- **"Show me..."** - Lists and filters tasks  
- **"Complete the..."** - Marks tasks as done
- **"Help me plan..."** - Uses prompts for planning
- **"What tasks are due today?"** - Smart filtering
- **"Break down this task..."** - Task decomposition

## Features Demonstrated

### ðŸŽ¯ **Natural Language Processing**
The client interprets natural language commands and maps them to appropriate MCP tool calls.

### ðŸ”„ **Real-time Updates**
Changes made through tools are immediately reflected in resources and the client interface.

### ðŸ’¾ **Data Persistence**
All tasks and data are stored in SQLite database with proper schema management.

### ðŸ§  **Smart Prompts**
AI-powered prompts help with task planning, breakdown, and productivity optimization.

### âš¡ **Interactive Experience**
The client feels like chatting with an assistant, not using a command-line tool.

## Advanced Features

- **Context Awareness** - Client remembers conversation context
- **Smart Suggestions** - Proactive recommendations based on task patterns
- **Batch Operations** - Handle multiple tasks in one command
- **Natural Language Queries** - "What did I accomplish this week?"
- **Integration Ready** - Easy to extend with calendar, email, etc.

## Why This Tutorial Matters

This tutorial shows you how to:

1. **Build Production Systems** - Real database, error handling, logging
2. **Create Great UX** - Natural language interface that users love
3. **Integrate Everything** - Tools, resources, and prompts working together
4. **Handle Complexity** - Task relationships, priorities, projects
5. **Scale Properly** - Architecture that can grow with requirements

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you'll be ready to:
- Build your own MCP servers for any domain
- Create interactive clients for better user experience
- Integrate MCP systems into larger applications
- Design natural language interfaces for technical systems
