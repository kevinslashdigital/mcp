# Tutorial: Building a File System MCP Server

Learn how to create an MCP server that provides file system operations as tools and resources.

## What You'll Build

A file system MCP server that provides:
- **Tools**: Create, read, write, delete files and directories
- **Resources**: Browse directory contents and file metadata
- **Prompts**: Generate file operation scripts and documentation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `uv` package manager
- Basic understanding of file systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- How to implement file system operations safely
- Resource management for directory browsing
- Error handling and security considerations
- Testing file system operations

## Project Structure

```
file-system-server/
├── server.py          # Main MCP server
├── file_operations.py # File system utilities
├── security.py        # Security and validation
├── test_server.py     # Tests
└── client.py          # Example client
```

## Step 1: Setup

Create a new project:

```bash
uv init file-system-server
cd file-system-server
uv add "mcp[cli]" "pathlib"
```

## Next Steps

Follow the implementation guide in the subsequent files to build your file system MCP server.

## Safety Note

⚠️ **Important**: This tutorial includes file system operations. Always validate paths and implement proper security measures in production use.
